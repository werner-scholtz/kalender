/// A calendar event that can be displayed and managed by calendar views.
///
/// A [CalendarEvent] represents a time-based item with optional associated data
/// that can be rendered in calendar interfaces. Each event has a defined time
/// range and supports various interaction modes for user operations.
///
/// ```dart
/// // Simple event
/// final meeting = CalendarEvent<String>(
///   dateTimeRange: DateTimeRange(
///     start: DateTime(2024, 1, 15, 14, 0),
///     end: DateTime(2024, 1, 15, 15, 0),
///   ),
///   data: 'Team Meeting',
/// );
///
/// // Multi-day event with custom interaction
/// final conference = CalendarEvent<Conference>(
///   dateTimeRange: DateTimeRange(
///     start: DateTime(2024, 3, 1),
///     end: DateTime(2024, 3, 3),
///   ),
///   data: Conference('Flutter Forward'),
///   interaction: EventInteraction.allowResize(),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// All time calculations are performed in UTC internally for consistency.
/// Use the timezone-aware methods for location-specific operations:
///
/// ```dart
/// final nyLocation = getLocation('America/New_York');
///
/// // Get UTC time range
/// final utcRange = event.dateTimeRangeAsUtc(nyLocation);
///
/// // Get dates the event spans in a specific timezone
/// final spannedDates = event.datesSpanned(nyLocation);
/// ```
///
/// ## Event Identification
///
/// Events are automatically assigned unique IDs by the [EventsController].
/// Do not manually set the [id] property as it's managed internally.
///
/// See also:
/// - [EventsController] for managing collections of events
/// - [EventInteraction] for configuring user interaction permissions
/// - [UtcDateTimeRange] for timezone-aware time ranges
class CalendarEvent<T extends Object?> {
  /// The optional data associated with this event.

  /// application-specific information about the event such as
  /// titles, descriptions, or complex domain objects.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final event = CalendarEvent<Meeting>(
  ///   data: Meeting(title: 'Stand-up', attendees: ['Alice', 'Bob']),
  ///   dateTimeRange: someRange,
  /// );
  /// ```

  /// EventInteraction.allowAll()

  ///
